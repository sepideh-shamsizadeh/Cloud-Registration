# Cloud-Registration
***Description:*** Worked on a project to develop a cloud registration system using C++ and PCL/Open3D libraries. The goal of the project was to find the alignment transformation between a source and a target point cloud.

***Key Accomplishments:***

- Developed expertise in point cloud preprocessing, feature extraction and matching, and registration refinement.
- Demonstrated proficiency in cloud filtering, downsampling, and normals computation.
- Utilized the FPFH feature extraction and matching technique to perform global registration and refine the registration using ICP.
- Implemented point cloud visualization using the PCL or Open3D libraries.

***Skills:*** C++, PCL/Open3D libraries, point cloud processing, feature extraction and matching, global registration, ICP, point cloud visualization.

The project highlighted my problem-solving and critical thinking skills, as well as my ability to work effectively in a team environment. It also provided me with hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and techniques used in the field of computer vision and robotics.
